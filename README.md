My primary ocupation is electronics designer and embedded C-C++ programmer. I'm proficient in analog as well mixed signal designs
and regularly use all the tools needed for the task (schematic capture, EDA/CAD/CAM design software, programming software

I usually work in embedded projects engineering, but I'm migrating to fullstack web programming right now, because (you may know)
nowadays the interaction point of hardware and user is into a network enabled device.
